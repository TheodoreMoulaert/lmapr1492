# Computational Materials Science - MAPR1492

This repository contains the Jupyter notebooks and associated files developed as part of the final project for the course.
## Overview

This repository is structured to provide a comprehensive understanding of computational materials science through a series of Jupyter notebooks. Each notebook addresses specific tasks and topics, contributing to the overall goal of analyzing and understanding material properties using computational methods.

The notebooks cover a range of topics, including the downloading and preparation of material data from the Materials Project database, the calculation and visualization of electronic band structures, the analysis of lattice structures and dynamics, the interpretation of phonon band structures, the exploration of symmetry operations, and the simulation and analysis of X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns.
